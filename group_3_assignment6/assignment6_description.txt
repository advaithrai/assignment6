This simulation depicts an ecosystem consisting of predators, prey, and plants, each of which are represented by their own class. The Predator and Prey classes have eat functions. If a prey object is in the same location as a plant object, it will eat the plant, keeping track of how many plants have been eaten, and the plant will disappear. If a predator object is in the same location as a prey object, it will eat the prey, keeping track of how many prey have been eaten, and the prey will disappear. Prey are herbivores and only eat plants, while predators are carnivores and only eat prey. All three classes have reproduce functions, by which new objects are added to the simulation. Plants reproduce after 6 seconds have elapsed, while prey reproduce after eating 3 plants and predators reproduce after eating 2 prey. The Predator and Prey classes have move functions that allow them to move in order to pursue food. Predators move in a random diagonal direction while prey move in a random x or y direction. 

Alex was responsible for the Prey class, Advaith was responsible for the Plant class, and Jina was responsible for the Predator class. The group worked together to implement the classes into the final simulation.
